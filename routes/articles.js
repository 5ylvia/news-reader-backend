This way when the request arrives at the end point the article is already retrieved and available, and the code for retreival doesn't have to be repeated for eah endpoint

// similar to post but updating. A different method is used here, findByIdAndUpdate(). There are different ways to achieve the same or similar results so referring to the documentation is important. find() and then save() could also be used here for example
